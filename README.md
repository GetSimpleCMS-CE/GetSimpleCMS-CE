## Features :bulb:

### XML Based ###
We don't use mySQL to store our information, but instead depend the simplicity of XML. By utilizing XML, we are able stay away from introducing an extra layer of slowness and complexity associated with connecting to a mySQL database. Because GetSimple was built specifically for the small-site market, we feel this is the absolutely best option for data storage.

### Easy to Learn UI ###
The top priority when designing our user-interface was to make it the best in it's class. We had the luxury of trying and testing all the competing management systems before designing ours, so we took the best out of each one - then refined it.

### Simple Installation ###
The total time in setting up a website took a total of 5 minutes, from starting the FTP to finishing the setup procedure.

### Easy Theme Customization ###
We have how to documents that show you how to create a custom theme. Our goal was not to bloat our software with hundreds of little-used theme functions, but to offer more than enough to allow for a fully customized theme.

### Plugins & Expandability ###
Designed to be light and agile, the base install comes to you clutter free, without dozens of extras you dont need. But of course we do have an ever growing selection of extensions ready to use and easy to install. Everything that you or your client are looking for‚Ä¶

## History üìú
GetSimple CMS was created in 2009 by the US web developer Chris Cagle, who presided over the project as a senior developer. Cage claimed he created GetSimple CMS out of the need of a CMS that was "as powerful as WordPress is to use", but easier. Since then, other developers have joined the GetSimple team. An active community contributes plug-ins, translations and themes. Though by 2020, development had slowed considerably as the original team (Shawn Alverson, Mike Swan, among many others) were no longer able to dedicate their time and resources to the project.

In November 2024 the official website was hacked, loosing access to vast amount of knowledge via its forum, as well as plugin, theme and language downloads.

Recognizing the lapse in development and support on the current official website, since 2022 we've taken the initiative to breathe new life into the platform by providing the essential updates it deserves, ensuring the advancement of this vital project.

This edition aims to introduce a range of improvements, including support for modern PHP versions, and is continuously maintained with new features that are not available in the standard version upon installation.

In 2023, the website GetSimple CMS CE Website was launched to inform users about updates and serve as a platform where the latest version of this software can be downloaded.
